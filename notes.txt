What tests should you write?

- Look at each individual part of your application and pretend that you are explaining each part of
    that component to a stranger.
- What you say to that stranger is exactly what you should be testing.

REMEMBER: None of these tests are actually runniing in the browser.
- All your tests are being run in the CLI environment.

- Create React App installs a dependency called JSDOM that tricks the code
to thinking that is being run in the browser.

JSDOM
=====
- jsdom is a pure-JavaScript implementation of many web standards, notably
the WHATWG DOM and HTML Standards, for use with Node.js. In general, the goal
of the project is to emulate enough of a subset of a web browser to be
useful for testing and scraping real-world web applications.

ENZYME
======
- In essence, enzyme makes it easier to test the instance of components in other components without
having to write a heap of boiler plate code.

From the github page:
- Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your
React Components' output. You can also manipulate, traverse, and in some ways simulate runtime given the output.
